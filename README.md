                                                         PHP Projects
The projects wer coded in PHP.Most of these are school projects and were done for course work.I am coding my own website in PHP.The work is in progess.
One of the Project is a Webpage which calculates your age.Its called birthomatic.Download and check how it works.
I used PHP to code the pages,CSS3 for stylesheets,HTML and Javascript for programming along with Jquery.Database used was MySQL.
Feel free to browse and make andy corrections.These projects contain both front and back end programming.I have attached all the files i used for development.
Enjoy Coding!!!
Cheers!!!
